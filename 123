To view hidden files in a file browser (like File Explorer in Windows, Finder in macOS, or a file manager in Linux), you'll need to toggle the visibility of hidden files. Here's how you can do it on different operating systems:

Windows:
Open File Explorer.
Go to the directory where you want to view hidden files.
Click on the "View" tab in the toolbar.
Check the box that says "Hidden items." This will toggle the visibility of hidden files and folders in the current directory.
macOS:
Open Finder.
Go to the directory where you want to view hidden files.
Press Command + Shift + . (period). This keyboard shortcut toggles the visibility of hidden files in the current directory.
