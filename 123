Command Line (All Operating Systems):
If you're using the command line, you can list all files, including hidden ones, using a terminal or command prompt:

On Linux/macOS, use the command ls -a in the terminal.
On Windows, use the command dir /a in the command prompt.
This will show all files, including hidden ones, in the current directory.

Remember, hidden files in Unix-like systems are typically denoted by a dot (.) at the beginning of their names. For example, .git is a hidden directory used by Git.

Always be cautious when working with hidden files, as they often contain important system configurations. Modifying or deleting them without proper knowledge can cause problems.
